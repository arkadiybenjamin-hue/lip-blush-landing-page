    q: 'Will it look like lipstick?',
    a: 'It depends on your goal. Some people want a barely-there tint, while others want a more visible color. This is discussed during the consultation.',

    q: 'Will it look like lip liner?',
    a: 'No. The goal is soft, blended color rather than a hard outline.',

    q: 'Can lip blush make my lips look bigger?',
    a: "It does not add volume like filler, but it can make your natural lip shape look more visible and defined.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Will the color look too bright at first?',
    a: 'It can look brighter during the first few days, then softens as it heals.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does it hurt?',
    a: 'Some discomfort is normal because lips are sensitive. Numbing is used to help keep the treatment more comfortable.',

    q: 'How long does it last?',
    a: 'It varies by person. Some people hold color longer than others, and some may need a refresh sooner.',

    q: 'What if I get cold sores?',
    a: "Tell your artist before booking. Lip tattooing can sometimes trigger an outbreak, so you may need to speak with your doctor about antiviral medication beforehand.",
